# React github app
> 
I created this application, in order to apply what I studied with react.
This application makes a request in the github api and returns users, repositories and favorite repositories.

## Development setup

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install
```
#### Start server
the server.js will use port:3000
```sh
npm start
```

## Usage example

## Others

For this app I used my own [scaffold](https://github.com/leandrocarra/react-scaffold) for React
